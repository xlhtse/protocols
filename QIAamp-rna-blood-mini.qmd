Simplified protocol for QIAamp RNA Blood Mini kit

----

# Materials

- QIAamp Spin Columns (clear)  
- QIAshredder Spin Columns (lilac)  
- Collection Tubes (1.5 ml)  
- Collection Tubes (2 ml)  
- Buffer EL
- Buffer RLT
- Buffer RW1
- Buffer RPE[^before 1st use: add 4 volumes of 96-100% ethanol to make a working solution]
- RNase-free Water 

# Equipments
- Centrifuge (for 14 mL / 50 mL tubes, with cooling)
- Primary TC hood 
\newpage

# notes
- A maximum of 1 x 10^7^ leukocytes can be processed on a QIAamp spin column. 


# Preparation
- Add 20 uL of 2 M dithiothreitol (DTT) per 1 mL Buffer RLT before use



# Procedure
## Erythrocyte lysis

> Process in primary TC room (or designated location for clinical samples)

1. Mix 1 volume of whole blood with 5 volumes of Buffer EL. (i.e., 1 mL whole blood + 5 mL Buffer EL, mix in 14 mL tube)

2. Incubate 10-15 min on ice. Vortex briefly 2 times during incubation.

3. Centrifuge at 400 *g* 10 min at 4 °C.

4. Remove supernatant completely. 

5. Add 2 volumes Buffer EL per volume of whole blood used in step 1. Resuspend by vortexing briefly. (i.e., 2 mL Buffer EL for 1 mL whole blood)

6. Centrifuge at 400 *g* 10 min at 4 °C.

7. Remove supernatant completely.
    

## Sample lysis

1. Add Buffer RLT (w/ DTT) to the pelleted leukocytes accordingly
